# Pandas

Pandas is a popular open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets, along with tools for reading and writing data in different formats. Pandas is particularly useful for tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, and analysis in fields like data science, machine learning, finance, and statistics.

The two primary data structures in Pandas are:

1. **Series:** A one-dimensional array that can hold any data type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a single column in a database table.

2. **DataFrame:** A two-dimensional table of data with rows and columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of Series.

Pandas provides a wide range of functions and methods for tasks such as reading and writing data in various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.), data cleaning, reshaping, merging, grouping, and aggregating data, as well as statistical and mathematical operations.

To use Pandas in Python, you typically start by importing the library:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
